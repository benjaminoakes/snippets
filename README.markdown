Snippets
========

Description
-----------

These are little snippets of programs I write when I test out ideas.  Rather than throw them away, I store them here for the inevitable day when I think "gosh, how did I do that again?" or "did that actually work?"

I write primarily in Ruby, which is reflected here.  Feel free to fork and add your own.

This gives a kind of **rough** idea of how much I know about a given language -- the more snippets I've had to make, the more I've probably written.  Even so, I've only made these heavily for the last couple years, they're not complete, and only include languages that I can easily call up in the terminal of my Macs or Linux boxes.

Disclaimer
----------

I make *no guarantee* of any of this code functioning or serving any specific need.  (I do try to mark code that doesn't work, though.)  These programs are here primarily for educational or reference value.

That being said, I do hope you find them useful.  (I'd love to hear from you if so.)

Layout
------

I've organized the snippets by language, each language having its own directory.  The title of each file should give a clue about its purpose.  Keep in mind, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented.  (They're "prototype" or "experimental" code.)

Many files are called something like `foo_sandbox` because some languages (like Ruby) will not find external libraries correctly if they have the same name as the current file.  It can cause annoying bugs (which is why I gained the habit of adding `_sandbox` on the end).
