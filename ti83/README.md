TI-83 Plus Calculator Programs
------------------------------

Since this calculator doesn't seem to be going away *ever* (see http://xkcd.com/768/), I thought I'd write down these programs before getting rid of my calculator.  They're written in TI83 Basic.  I probably wrote them around 2000-2005.  Keep in mind they were written on a 16 character by 7 line display.
