IMPORTANT NOTE:  I haven't written much Python since maybe 2004.  It was the first programming language I ever really did anything with, so this code probably doesn't reflect my current style of writing.  It was also while I was in the middle of High School, so I didn't have any "formal" training through college, etc.
