h1. Snippets

h2. Description

These are little snippets of programs I write when I test out ideas.  Rather than throw them away, I store them here for the inevitable day when I think "gosh, how did I do that again?"

Feel free to fork and add your own.

h2. Disclaimer

I make *no guarantee* of any of this code functioning or serving any specific need.  These programs are here primarily for educational or reference value.  That being said, I do hope you find them useful.

h2. Layout

I've organized the snippets by language, each language having its own directory.  The title of each file should give a clue about its purpose.  Keep in mind, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented.  (They're "prototype" or "experimental" code.)

Many files are called something like "foo_sandbox" because some languages (like Ruby) will not find external libraries correctly if they have the same name as the current file.  It can cause little, annoying bugs (which is why I gained the habit of adding "_sandbox" on the end).
