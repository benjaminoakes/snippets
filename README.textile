h1. Snippets

h2. Description

These are little snippets of programs I write when I test out ideas.  Rather than throw it away, I store them here for the inevitable day where I think "gosh, how did I do that again?"

Feel free to fork and add your own.

h2. Disclaimer

I make no guarantee of any of this code functioning or serving any specific need.  It's here primarily for educational or reference value.

h2. Layout

I've organized the snippets by language, each having its own directory.  The title of each file should give a clue about its purpose.  Keep in mind, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented.  (They're "prototype" or "experimental" code.)
